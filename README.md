## Abstract
My Submission for Week 2 Homework during my time at the Monash Coding Bootcamp. This homework project was to create a online portfolio type webpage. I followed the guidelines to the best of my abilities, eventually making a website that vaguley resembles the suggested image.

## Notes
I had a couple of difficulties i encountered during this project. The main difficult came with my enthusiasm to make animated GIFS work during the state of hover. This was severely effect the ability for my elements to flex on the page, at least with my current CSS/HTML knowledge.
Another issue i was having was keeping the right borders on the subheadings in the same line. I pondered for a solid hour or so as to why this was occuring, doing frantic google searches and trying to debug my code, in the end i could not come up with a reasonable solution as to why this was occuring. 

# To do when my knowledge expands.
Fix issues with Flex whilst maintaining GIF capabilities. 
Fix issues with right side border on sub headings. 
Edit links to be new links to actual projects i have completed
